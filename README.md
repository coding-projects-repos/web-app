# Coding Projects Web App

This is the repo for the client & server of [codingprojects.net](https://codingprojects.net). Feel free to contribute; we're always looking for improvements.

The stack used is Next.js & React on the client, and Express on the server. All in TypeScript.

## Requirements

You must have docker installed on your local machine and know some basic git-fu.

## Setup

Clone the repo onto your local computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/coding-projects-repos/web-app
```

Install the packages

```
npm install
```

Build and start the server:

```
docker-compose up
```
